COVID-19 Image Detection Using CNN, is a cutting-edge application of deep learning in the medical field.The project leverages Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to predict whether a person has COVID-19 based on their X-ray images. By inputting X-ray scans into the CNN model, the system is trained to recognize patterns and anomalies indicative of COVID-19. The model then classifies the images, offering a prediction of whether the individual is likely to have contracted the virus. This approach not only enhances the speed and accuracy of diagnosis but also provides a valuable tool for healthcare professionals in the ongoing fight against the pandemic. The project demonstrates the potential of AI in revolutionizing medical diagnostics and improving patient outcomes.

 I experimented with various values for the dense layer to optimize and improve the accuracy of my CNN model. By adjusting these values, I fine-tuned the network's ability to learn and generalize from the X-ray images, ultimately enhancing its predictive performance in detecting COVID-19.
